# Natural Image Sizing with Border Wrapping

## What Changed

### 🎯 **New Approach: Natural Sizing**

- **Removed**: Fixed `width` and `height` values
- **Added**: `maxWidth` and `maxHeight` constraints only
- **Removed**: `contentFit` property completely
- **Result**: Images size themselves naturally, border wraps around actual image

### 📐 **How It Works Now**

1. **Image loads at its natural dimensions**
2. **Constrained by maxWidth/maxHeight** (if image is too large)
3. **Border appears exactly around the image content**
4. **No forced resizing or cropping**

### 🖼️ **Visual Results**

- **Vertical images**: Display tall and narrow with tight border
- **Horizontal images**: Display wide and short with tight border
- **Square images**: Display square with tight border
- **Large images**: Scale down to fit within max constraints
- **Small images**: Display at natural size

### 📱 **Responsive Constraints**

**Desktop:**

- maxWidth: 70%
- maxHeight: 500px

**Mobile:**

- maxWidth: 90%
- maxHeight: 350px

### ✅ **Benefits**

✅ Border follows the exact shape and size of each image  
✅ No cropping or stretching  
✅ Natural aspect ratios preserved  
✅ Each image can be a different size  
✅ Border acts like a custom picture frame for each photo

Your images now display exactly as they were taken, with borders that perfectly frame each one! 📸✨
