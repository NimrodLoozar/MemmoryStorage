# Error Fixed: GalleryStyles Import Issue

## 🐛 **Problem**

```
Uncaught Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'galleryContainer')
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The `GalleryStyles.ts` file became empty during our previous edits, causing the import to fail and `GalleryStyles.galleryContainer` to be undefined.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### 1. **Recreated GalleryStyles.ts**

- Restored the complete file with all necessary styles
- Included both original styles and new natural aspect ratio styles
- Maintained proper TypeScript/React Native syntax

### 2. **Verified Imports**

- Confirmed `@/styles` barrel export is working
- Verified component imports are correct
- All style references should now resolve properly

## 📁 **File Restored**

`styles/GalleryStyles.ts` now contains:

- ✅ galleryContainer
- ✅ galleryTitle
- ✅ imageScrollView
- ✅ naturalImageContainer
- ✅ naturalGalleryImage
- ✅ Navigation styles
- ✅ Dot indicator styles
- ✅ All responsive variants

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

The app should now load without the undefined property error and display images with natural aspect ratios and proper borders.

The error was a simple case of an empty file breaking the import chain! 🔧
