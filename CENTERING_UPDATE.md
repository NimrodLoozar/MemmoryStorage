# Image Centering Update

## Changes Made to Center Images

### 1. Enhanced `ImageWithTightBorder` Component

- Added centered alignment to the main container with `alignItems: 'center'`, `justifyContent: 'center'`, and `flex: 1`
- Ensures the image wrapper is perfectly centered within its container space

### 2. Updated Gallery Styles (`GalleryStyles.ts`)

- **`imageWithBorderWrapper`**: Added `alignSelf: 'center'` to center the wrapper itself within its parent
- **`horizontalImageContainer` & `verticalImageContainer`**: Added `flex: 1` to allow full space usage for optimal centering

### 3. Updated CSS Styles (`GalleryStyles.css`)

- **`.image-with-border-wrapper`**: Added `align-self: center` for web compatibility
- **`.image-container`**: Added `flex: 1` for consistent centering behavior across platforms

## Results

- ✅ **Perfect Horizontal Centering**: Images are now perfectly centered horizontally within their containers
- ✅ **Perfect Vertical Centering**: Images are centered vertically within the available space
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Centering works identically on mobile and web
- ✅ **Maintained Responsiveness**: All responsive behaviors preserved while adding centering
- ✅ **Preserved Border Fitting**: Tight-fitting borders remain perfectly fitted to image content

## Technical Details

The centering is achieved through multiple layers:

1. **Container Level**: `horizontalImageContainer` and `verticalImageContainer` center content
2. **Component Level**: `ImageWithTightBorder` applies additional centering with flex properties
3. **Wrapper Level**: `imageWithBorderWrapper` uses `alignSelf: center` to center itself
4. **Cross-Platform**: Both TypeScript and CSS styles ensure consistent behavior

The result is perfectly centered images that maintain their tight-fitting borders and responsive behavior across all screen sizes and orientations.
